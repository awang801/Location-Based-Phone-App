# UI Implementation Reference

### Description
The files within this directory have been automatically generated by the _Sketch Measurement_ plugin for _Sketch_, the same application used to create our initial UI wireframes.

### Target Device
* `Nexus 5`


## Future Reference File Generation
### Instructions
Should these designs be edited or redesigned at any point in the future, their respective reference files can be created by going to `Plugins > Sketch Measure > Spec Export` and then verifying all **_Export Settings_** comply with the specifications detailed below.

### Export Settings
* **Design Resolution –** `xxhdpi @3x`
* **Scale –** `3` (this should be done automatically after specifying  a **Design Resolution**)
* **Unit –** `dp/sp` this will make the standard unit used in the reference file `dp` and the standard text size `sp`
* **Color Format –** `Color hex`
